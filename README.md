# Bike Sharing
## Overview of Project
###Project Purpose
We want to start a bike rental company in Des Moines, Iowa that is similar to CitiBikes in New York City. 

###Scope of Project
I used the rideshare data from CitiBike from August 2019 to research the feasability of starting this company.
I utilized Tableau to visualize the data.

##Results
### Rider Demographics:

1. The majority of riders are males.
2. Most riders are subscribers of the bike share service - not single use riders.
3. Most riders are 21 - 60 years old.


### Ride Information:

1. Most rides occur durning the commuting hours Monday - Friday.
2. While most riders are male, female and male riders tend to use the bikes at similar times.
3. Thursdays are the heaviest ride days.

##Summary
Our target market for our bike sharing service is working age males. To accurately determine the number of bikes we'll need we should compare the following for NYC and Des Moines:
1. Total population
2. Male residents aged 21 - 60
3. Size of the work force
